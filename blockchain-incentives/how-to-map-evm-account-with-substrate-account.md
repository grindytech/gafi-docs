# How to Map EVM account with Substrate account

Proof Address Mapping is the easy, secure way to deal with Address Mapping to map two addresses between the Substrate(H256) address and EVM(H160) address. By providing proof that the signature belongs to you. Please visit [Proof Address Mapping](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/proof-address-mapping) to learn more about it.

The following steps will help you map your EVM account and Substrate account.

**1. Create Substrate account**\
The first thing you need to do is create your own Substrate account (if you don't have one yet). Please refer to the document of [RMRK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spSPykclJ8I\&ab\_channel=RMRK) or [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.foundation/tutorials/create-polkadot-js-account/).

**2. Get the faucet**

After you have your own Substrate account let go to [Gafi App](https://apps.gafi.network/admin/dashboard) to get the Faucet.

**3. Setup Metamask**\
First, you need to create the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) account if you don't have one yet. Then set up the GAKI network

**Chain ID**: 1337\
**Symbol**: GAFI

Once you finish, you can see your Metamask account sharing the same balance as your Substrate account.
