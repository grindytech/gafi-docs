### Change the smart contract ownership

Once you have claimed the smart contract ownership, you can change the owner of the contract by simply clicking on "Change owner".\
_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Warning**</mark>**:** once you changed the owner, you are **no longer** the owner of the contract, and "developer-onchain-reward" does not reward you._
