**Play**: Gafi provides an unparalleled method to explosive the Web3 Gaming adoption. Even from zero experience with blockchain to the most used environment Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) and to the promising environment WASM.

**Rewarded**: With exclusive mechanisms, all the players, developers, and game studios on Gafi can earn a significant reward when playing, building, and operating on Gafi Network.

**Trade**: The first Cross-Non-Fungile Tokens(C-NFT) that help users can utilize the C-NFT in multiple environments and marketplaces.

Gafi Network is the layer one blockchain that is built from [Substrate](https://substrate.io/), and we intend to be Kusama/Polkadot parachain to inherit the security of [the Relay Chain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture).
