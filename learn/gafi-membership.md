# Gafi Membership

Inspired by Web2 online gaming membership, where players can buy and become a member to unlock some kind of privileges such as special game items, authority to join events, discounts on the markets, etc...

#### How does Gafi Membership work?

In Gafi Network, to reward the loyalty of players, Gafi Membership will reward the players depending on the level of the member.

The level of the membership depends on the time member use Gafi's services, the longer member uses services the higher level of the membership and the more privileges they will receive.

Gafi Membership will be reset every 24 weeks (12 weeks on Kusama Parachain). After the Gafi Membership is reset, all membership records will be cleaned. All members have to register the membership and started from level 0 again.
