# Upgradable NFTs

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are considered to be the heart of the blockchain game and also the fastest growing in the blockchain space. NFTs are used to certify ownership and authenticity. It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided. NFTs typically contain references to digital assets such as artworks, photos, videos, and audio. - source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible\_token).

Looking back at the history of Blockchain Games starting with CryptoKitty, they used the ERC721 Token Standard for in-game finance, but this was the wall that stopped them from scaling. For Blockchain Games, ERC721 is extremely expensive on blockchain resources, thus causing an unexpected increase in transaction fees.\
To solve this problem, a new token standard ERC1155 was born, taking ideas from all ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777. For Blockchain Games, this is like a lifesaver to help them solve transaction fee problems and provide more flexible functionality to handle a large amount of assets in the game.

Unlike most NFTs, in-game assets are changeable or upgradeable. Nearly all games allow in-game items that can be transformed into better items with better attributes that make the gameplay more enjoyable.

Gafi builds an ERC1155-like Token Standard for efficient use of blockchain resources and allows NFTs to be upgradable on-chain. NFT upgrade rules are set by Studio, and for a certain upgrade fee, gamers can convert their NFTs.
