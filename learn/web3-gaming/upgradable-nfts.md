# Upgradable NFTs

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are the cornerstone of blockchain gaming and represent one of the fastest-growing sectors within the blockchain space. NFTs, as per Wikipedia, are used to certify ownership and authenticity of digital assets such as artworks, photos, videos, and audio. They cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided.

I. The Evolution of Blockchain Gaming and NFT Standards

Early blockchain games like CryptoKitty used the ERC721 Token Standard for in-game finance. However, this standard proved to be a barrier to scalability due to its high cost in terms of blockchain resources, leading to a significant increase in transaction fees.

To address this issue, the ERC1155 Token Standard was introduced, incorporating features from ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777 standards. This new standard significantly reduced transaction fees and provided greater flexibility in managing large quantities of in-game assets.

II. The Introduction of Upgradable NFTs

Most in-game assets have the potential to be upgraded or transformed into better items with improved attributes, enhancing the gaming experience. However, traditional NFTs do not support on-chain upgrades.

Gafi has innovatively built an ERC1155-like Token Standard that not only utilizes blockchain resources efficiently but also allows NFTs to be upgraded on-chain. Game studios can set the rules for NFT upgrades, and for a specific upgrade fee, gamers can enhance their NFTs.
