The Triangle represents three parts of Web3 Gaming: Blockchain, Player, and Game.

1. Gafi on the web3 gaming model is to keep the in-game assets, in-game records, and player's info on the blockchain with the highest level of security.\
   Then the Transparency Random Mint is the mechanism where players can mint NFTs with free-trust flesh randomly in a transparent way.\
   And the marketplace provides outstanding value to in-game finance, where players can freely do many financial activities with their assets.
2. Players on this model can enjoy playing the game and have extreme control over their in-game assets.
3. Game on the web3 gaming is pretty much the same as traditional games in the gameplay and game experience. Except for the in-game assets, in-game records, and player info are stored securely on the blockchain.
