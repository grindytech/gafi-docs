# Mining Pool NFTs

Traditionally, blockchain games generate in-game items on the game server, which are then minted as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) through the blockchain. This process often leaves several uncertainties, such as the rarity of the NFT, the total number of NFTs, and the chances of mining them. Consequently, gamers can end up investing heavily in mining high-value items that may never be minted. Gafi addresses this issue with a clear and transparent approach to publishing NFTs, utilizing two distinct Mining Pool mechanisms inspired by the Video Game - Loot Table concept.

I. Stable Mining Pool

A Stable Mining Pool comprises an infinite supply of NFTs, possibly from different collections. The mining opportunity in this pool depends on:

1. The weight or quantity of NFTs in the pool. The fewer NFTs in the pool, the rarer the NFT becomes.
2. The mining chances for NFTs remain constant after each mining operation but may change if the pool admin alters the weights within the Mining Pool.

II. Dynamic Mining Pool

A Dynamic Mining Pool consists of NFTs, possibly from different collections, with a limited supply. The mining opportunity here depends on:

1. The weight or quantity of NFTs in the pool. Similar to the Stable Mining Pool, the fewer NFTs in the pool, the rarer the NFT becomes.
2. Each NFT minted is removed from the pool, resulting in a slight change in the mining chances.
3. The mining chance for NFTs can change if the pool admin changes the weights within the Mining Pool.

Gafi's innovative approach to NFT mining pools provides gamers with a transparent and fair system, ensuring they have clear expectations when investing in mining operations.
