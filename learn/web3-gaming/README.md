The gaming industry is a behemoth, with over 3 billion users worldwide. Advancements in hardware technology have allowed games to create virtual worlds that surpass our wildest imaginations. This technology has also had a ripple effect, benefiting various industries such as cinematography, construction, and medicine. However, when it comes to in-game finances, not much has changed from the traditional model.
