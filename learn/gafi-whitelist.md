# Gafi Whitelist

## Use Cases

1. Create whitelist\
   For some reason, when you are a game project and you want to restrict players to get the discount when playing with your games. Simply you can just create a whitelist with a list of allowed players, for those who are not in the whitelist will not receive the discount from Funding Pool./
2. Free to Play\
   In the exclusive feature Free to Play, Funding Pool is potentially being attacked by spammers that make the pool run out of fund reserve. To protect the pool, Gafi Whitelist is the best way to restrict players to play for free.
