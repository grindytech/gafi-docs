# Zero Cost Integration

Blockchain integration is considered one of the most expensive processes when it comes to adoption, the costs here can be human resources, additional budget services, and trade-offs for game experience and security. In order for Game Web3 to be widely adopted, Gafi has eliminated all the problems in the traditional way, let's compare to learn more.

**I. Traditional Race of Web3 Gaming Integration**

From the traditional game to emerge to web3 gaming. The studio is likely walking through six milestones below:

1. Design NFTs\
   During this milestone, the studio will design which in-game assets they want to publish as NFT. The rarity depends on the quantity, properties, and reusability of the asset.
2. Develop Smart Contract\
   Developing is the process of learning, coding, testing, auditing, and deploying, which requires a large amount of work. This milestone is rarely outsourced as a traditional game because of the risk of unexpected exploits.
3. Mint NFTs\
   In this milestone, blockchain gaming will mint NFTs and integrate them into their games. If any errors or just changes happen, they have to start over to replace them with new ones.
4. Build Marketplace\
   Sure, another way to sell NFTs is to sell on a decentralized marketplace like OpenSea or Blur. But this is not likely to happen when the market considers primary revenue in the long run, so building their own marketplace offers flexibility in terms of transaction fees and UX/UI customization.
5. Publish NFTs\
   Finally, after a long road of building and testing for months or years. Their in-game assets will be published as NFTs.

**II. Gafi Race**
