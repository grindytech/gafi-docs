Web3 gaming integration consider is the most costly process. From the traditional game to emerge to web3 gaming, Studio is likely walking through six milestones:

1. Design NFTs\
   In this milestone, the studio will design which in-game assets they want to publish as NFTs. The variety by the amount, attribute, and reusability of the assets.
2. Develop Smart Contract\
   To develop is the process of learning, coding, auditing, and deploying which took a massive amount of work. This milestone rarely be outsourced as a traditional game with only game developers because of the surprising risk of exploiting.
3. Mint NFTs\
   In this milestone, blockchain gaming will mint NFTs and integrate them into their games. If any bugs or just changes happen, they have to go all over again to replace them with new ones.
4. Build Marketplace\
   Sure, the alternative way to sell NFTs is to make a sale on a decentralized marketplace such as OpenSea, or Blur. But this is not likely to happen in which marketplace considering the main revenue in the long run that building their own marketplace provide flexibility on trading fee and UX/UI customization.
5. Publish NFTs\
   Finally, after a long road of building and testing over months or years. Their in-game assets will be published as NFTs.

Traditional Race not only took such a long development time and the resources to develop NFTs but also numerous other costly services such as auditing, running RPC nodes, cloud servers... etc.

**II. Gafi Race**
