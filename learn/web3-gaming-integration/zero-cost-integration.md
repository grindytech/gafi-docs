Web3 gaming integration consider is the most costly process of web3 gaming, and the studio is likely walking through six milestones:

1. Design NFTs\
   In this milestone, the studio will design which in-game assets they want to publish as NFTs. The variety by the amount, attribute, and reusability of the assets.
2. Develop Smart Contract\
   To develop is the process of learning, coding, auditing, and deploying which took a massive amount of work. This milestone rarely be outsourced as a traditional game with only game developers with the surprising risk of exploiting.
3. Mint NFTs\
   In this milestone, blockchain gaming will mint NFTs and integrate them into their games. If any bugs or just changes happen, they have to go all over again to replace them with new ones.
4. Build Marketplace\
   Sure, the alternative way to sell NFTs is to make a sale on a decentralized marketplace such as Open-Sea, or Blur. But this is not likely to happen in which marketplace considering the main revenue in the long run that building their own marketplace provide flexibility on trading fee and UX/UI customization.
5. Publish NFTs\
   Finally, after a long road of building and testing in months or years. Their in-game assets will be published as NFTs.
