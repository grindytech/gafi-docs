* The traditional game model consists of the Game and Player, this is a centralized model where all data is stored in the game from game assets and player information to game records. This model can completely wipe out the game because the game servers are very vulnerable to attacks and exploits.
* In-game items can be created and sold to the player without the player knowing the exact rarity or not, nor do they know how many premium items are in the game. Game items are likely to be one-way purchases as there is no market for trading.

2. Web3 Game Model

   Transparency Random Mint is a mechanism by which players can mint NFTs with new free-trust and transparent randomness.\
   The marketplace provides outstanding value to in-game finance, where players are free to perform a variety of financial operations with their assets.
2. Players on this model can enjoy playing the game with extreme control over their in-game assets and freely trade NFTs on Gafi Market.
3. Web3 gaming represents the game studio, with exclusive features, games can easily create and manage collections and NFTs in minutes.
