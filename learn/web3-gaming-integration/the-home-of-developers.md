# The Home of Developers

1. From a game developer to a blockchain developer\
   When emerging to web3 gaming, traditional games will take an endeavor journey to hire or train their developers to become blockchain developers which took years to learn and work, and this is likely the biggest barrier that hinders traditional games to make web3 integration.\
   \
   Gafi builds an exclusive environment for non-blockchain developers can use the APIs to fully manage the in-game finance. And yes, every developer or even non-developers is familiar with calling the APIs. From creating collections, items, or wishlists to minting, upgrading, trading,... can be done easily through APIs.\
   \
   From now on, game developers can easily integrate Gafi blockchain into their games with Zero costs and a couple of minutes.
2. Lack of incentives for developers\
   Developers are the most important role of any blockchain which helps its growth.\
   The lack of incentives for developers is another barrier that prevents web3 integration.\
   \
   To solve this problem, Gafi has the features:\
   \- Incentives Pool: the mechanism that helps developers can connect with their users.\
   \- Developer-Onchain-Reward: thirty percent of the transaction fee is rewarded to the developer.
