# New Development Environment

1. The problems of the development environment

When adopting web3 gaming, traditional games are likely to deal with three things:

* Developing smart-contract\
  Solidity is the most famous smart contract programming language for the Ethereum Environment, which is also the largest community in the blockchain space. However, Solidity is a new and nascent technology that takes an average of 6 months to learn. To build a blockchain game with Solidity, it took over 6 months to build, test, audit, and then deploy. If something went wrong, developers would deploy all over again and then replace new smart-contract addresses in all places.
* Building the blockchain node\
  To interact with the blockchain, the blockchain game needs stable PRC APIs. This can be a huge cost to run blockchain nodes and maintain them.
* Dealing with security\
  Since smart contracts are young and everyone can deploy their own smart contracts on the blockchain in any way they want. Thus, we have seen many hacks and thefts happening in the blockchain space. Usually, users will sign any transaction that comes in front of them with little or no research, and then hackers can take control of their accounts. Quite often, even reputable smart contracts have been exploited due to poor code quality.

2. What is the solution?

* Gafi builds an exclusive environment where developers can use APIs to fully manage in-game finances. And yes, every developer from blockchain to non-blockchain to non-developers is familiar with calling APIs. From creating collections and items to setting upgrade rules can be done easily via the API in just a matter of minutes.
* Gafi is built from a state-of-art blockchain framework: Substrate and the most loved programing language: Rust which is familiar to developers. Unlike most traditional blockchains, Gafi uses a new blockchain upgrade mechanism: [Forkless](https://docs.substrate.io/maintain/runtime-upgrades/) upgrade, any changes in the Gafi blockchain must go through governance (Community Audit), this mechanism brings extremely high security to the Gafi ecosystem.

In addition, developers can also use runtime features and earn significant rewards, for more information please visit [Blockchain Incentives](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/blockchain-incentives) to learn more.
