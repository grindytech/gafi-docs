   Buy a specific number of NFTs from `Set Price` with a `bid price`, to provent misbehavior, Buy item incluced the `bid price that` must be higher or equal to the `unit price.`
3. Set Order\
   Set a order to buy a number of NFTs in a collection with a bid. To create this trade, a user must be reserved an amount of (`unit price * number of NFTs).`This trade may be started in a specific block and period of the block. If run out of orders, you can add more.
