# Retail Trades

NFT retail trades involve the buying and selling of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within a retail context. In contrast to wholesale trades, where items are sold in bulk, retail trades allow for the sale of individual items or a fraction of items within a collection. The price associated with retail trades refers to the unit price of each NFT. Retail trades offer distinct convenience options and are characterized by four primary types:

1. Set Price\
   The set-price trade involves offering a fixed unit price for a specified number of NFTs within a collection. Initiating this trade requires reserving a predetermined quantity of NFTs. This trade can be activated during a specific block and within a designated time frame. It's important to note that if the available NFTs are exhausted, additional units can be added to the trade.
2. Buy Item\
   The buy item trade allows users to purchase a specific number of NFTs from the set-price trade by placing bids. To maintain fair behavior, the buy item trade necessitates including a bid price that is equal to or higher than the unit price. This mechanism helps ensure a secure and equitable transaction.
3. Set Order\
   With the set order trade, users can place an order to buy a defined number of NFTs from a collection by specifying a bid price. Creating this trade requires reserving an amount equal to the product of the unit price and the desired quantity of NFTs. Similar to other trades, the set order trade is subject to activation during a specific block and time period. If the available orders are exhausted, additional orders can be added.
4. Sell Item\
   The sell item trade enables users to sell a specified number of NFTs to the set order trade by setting an ask price. This ask price must be equal to or lower than the bid price specified in the set order trade. By maintaining this pricing alignment, the transaction process remains transparent and aligned with market dynamics.

**Note:** A small deposit is required for each trade. All trades can be canceled at any time, resulting in the release of reserved (locked) assets.
