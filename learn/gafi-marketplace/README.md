# Gafi Marketplace

The marketplace is an essential thing in any blockchain gaming, which is considered the main revenue for maintaining the game in the long run. Sadly, marketplace in the traditional blockchain gaming suffered from numerous problems.

The first problem is the rigidity of the current market, consider OpenSea and Blur as the two most popular decentralized markets today, but blockchain games rarely publish their NFT on it because of the poor transactional features and None of UX/UI customization. The second problem is that it is very difficult to build their own market because it consumes a lot of resources and risks game security.

To solve these problems, Gafi Marketplace offers:

* Variety trading functions such as set price, wishlist, swap, auction...
* Extremely flexible on trading customization
* No Network Trading fee
* Friendly UI/UX for games
* Outstanding security with [Community Audit](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/web3-gaming-integration/community-audit).
