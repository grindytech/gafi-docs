# Swap

A swap where you want to swap your NFTs for other NFTs may come with a deposit. Swapping can start within a specific block and for the duration of the blocks. To create this trade, the NFTs and small deposits must be reserved.

To execute a swap, you must have the required NFT and bid, the bid must be equal to or higher than the `asking price`.&#x20;
