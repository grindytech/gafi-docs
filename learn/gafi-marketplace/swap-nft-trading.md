# Swap NFT Trading

Swap NFT trading refers to the exchange of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) between two parties within the Gafi marketplace.

#### Create Swap

Initiating a swap NFT trade in the Gafi marketplace involves the following steps:

1. **Reserve NFTs:** The party initiating the swap must reserve the NFTs they intend to exchange. This step ensures that the NFTs are locked for the duration of the swap process.
2. **Asking Price:** The party creating the swap may set an asking price, indicating the value at which they are willing to exchange their NFT.
3. **Start and Duration:** Swap trading can commence within a specific block and remain open for the duration of the specified blocks within the Gafi platform.

#### Make Swap

Executing a swap NFT trade within the Gafi marketplace follows these steps:

1. **Required NFT and Bid:** To complete a swap, a participant must possess the NFT they intend to exchange and provide a bid. The bid represents the digital asset or value they are offering in exchange for the desired NFT.
2. **Bid Amount:** The bid amount must be equal to or higher than the asking price set by the party who created the swap. This ensures that the exchange maintains a fair value proposition for both participants.
