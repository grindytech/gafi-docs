# Auction

Gafi provides auction functions where you can buy or sell NFTs by offering them up for bids, taking bids, and then selling NFTs to the highest bidder or buying NFTs from the lowest bidder.

Currently, Gafi offers two types of auctions:

1. Forward auction\
   The auction starts with a specific block, and for a certain amount of time with the starting price, the highest bid wins when the auction ends.
2. Candle auction\
   Same as `Forward auction, except` that no one could know exactly when the auction would end and make a last-second bid.
