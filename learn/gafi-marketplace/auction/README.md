# Auction

Welcome to the dynamic world of auctions on Gafi Marketplace, where you have the power to unleash the full potential of your NFTs through strategic buying and selling. Our auction functions open up exciting avenues for trading, allowing you to place bids and offer your NFTs for auction, leading to successful transactions that benefit both buyers and sellers.

**Exploring Auctions on Gafi:**

Gafi Marketplace introduces cutting-edge auction features, offering you the opportunity to purchase or sell NFTs by initiating auctions, receiving bids, and ultimately securing transactions. Whether you're a collector seeking unique NFTs or a creator looking to monetize your creations, our auction system provides a robust platform for engaging in dynamic trading.

**Two Distinct Auction Types:**

Currently, Gafi Marketplace presents two distinct auction types, each catering to specific trading preferences:

**1. Forward Auction:** The forward auction initiates with precision, starting at a specific block and continuing for a defined period. This user-friendly format is particularly suitable for those who are new to auctions. Sellers set an opening price, and interested bidders place their bids. As the auction progresses, the highest bid stands to win the NFT when the auction concludes. This format encourages spirited bidding and rewards the bidder with the highest valuation.

**2. Candle Auction:** The candle auction follows the same principles as the forward auction, but with a thrilling twist. In this format, the end of the auction remains a mystery, as participants cannot predict the exact moment when the bidding will cease. This mechanism deters last-second bids and adds an element of suspense, creating a balanced and strategic bidding environment.

**Join the Auction Action:**

Whether you're a seasoned trader or a newcomer to the NFT world, Gafi Marketplace's auction functionalities offer a gateway to secure and engaging transactions. Embrace the thrill of competitive bidding, explore innovative auction formats, and unlock the potential of your NFTs in a dynamic marketplace designed to enhance your trading experience.
