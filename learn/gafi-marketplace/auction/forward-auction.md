# Forward Auction

1. **Introduction**

A forward auction is a basic auction in which the last bidder selected wins the auction. This auction is where you might want to sell or buy NFTs that are not available on Gafi Marketplace.&#x20;

2. How does a `forward auction` work?

* Start auction

Forward auction starts in a specific block with a starting price, for a certain period of time, the bidder has to bid higher than the starting price and also higher than the previous bidder.

* During auction

An auction cannot be canceled once created.

The currently selected bid is the highest bid at that time, the bid cannot be canceled after placing the bid, the higher bid will replace the currently selected bid and the lower bid will be refunded.

* Auction end

When the auction ends, anyone can execute the result. If the auction has no bidders, the property is returned.

3. **Conclusion**

Futures auctions can offer an efficient way to make competitive trades in a short period of time. However, auctions and bids cannot be canceled so you should be cautious. Forward auctions can be tricked by last-second bids, to prevent this problem Candel auction is where you should look.
