# Forward Auction

#### Introduction

A forward auction operates based on the concept of competitive bidding. In this type of auction, the highest bidder at the end of the auction period wins the item being auctioned. Forward auctions are particularly useful for selling or acquiring NFTs that are not readily available on the Gafi Marketplace.

How Does a Forward Auction Work?

**Starting the Auction**

1. **Start Auction:** A forward auction begins at a specific block with a predetermined starting price. The auction is set to run for a specified period, during which participants can place their bids.
2. **Bidding Process:** Bidders must submit bids that are higher than the starting price and any previous bids. The bid amount represents the price the bidder is willing to pay for the NFT.

**During the Auction**

1. **Bid Irrevocability:** Once a bid is placed, it cannot be canceled or withdrawn. This ensures the integrity of the auction process.
2. **Highest Bid Selection:** The highest bid at any given time becomes the currently selected bid. If a higher bid is placed, it replaces the previous highest bid. Lower bids are refunded.

**Auction Conclusion**

1. **Auction End:** When the auction's predetermined time period concludes, the highest bidder at that moment wins the NFT. The result of the auction can be executed by anyone.
2. **No Bidders:** If the auction concludes without any bidders, the NFT is returned to its original owner.

Conclusion

Forward auctions provide an efficient mechanism for engaging in competitive trades within a defined timeframe. However, it's important to note that bids and auctions are irrevocable, so participants should exercise caution and bid strategically. Forward auctions are susceptible to last-second bids, which can be mitigated by exploring alternative auction types such as Candle Auctions.
