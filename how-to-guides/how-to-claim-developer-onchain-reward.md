Following the steps to claim ownership of your smart-contract:

```
1. Navigate to Game Creator Section
2. Claim Contract
```

You can change the owner of the contract by simply clicking on "Change owner". _<mark style="color:yellow;">**Warning**</mark>**:** once you changed the owner, you are no longer the owner of the contract, and "developer-onchain-reward" does not reward you._

After claiming ownership of your contract successfully, every time your contract has been deployed, 30 percent of the transaction fee will go to you immediately.
