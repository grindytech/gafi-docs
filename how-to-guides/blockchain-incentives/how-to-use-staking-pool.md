# How to use Staking Pool

Upfront Pool provides staking-like services to reduce transaction fees, please go to [Staking Pool](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/staking-pool) to learn more about it.\
Make sure that you have finished mapping your accounts on the [How to Map EVM account with Substrate account](https://wiki.gafi.network/how-to-guides/how-to-map-evm-account-with-substrate-account) section.&#x20;

Following the steps help you understand how Staking Pool work:

1. **Deploy contract**\
   First, upload the contract ABI or use the demo Token

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/GAKI.json" %}
Demo GAKI token
{% endfile %}

After deploying successfully, you can see the transaction fee which is \~10.7 GAKI

**2. Join Staking**\
Now navigate to the [Staking Pool](https://apps.gafi.network/admin/staking-pool) section to try the demo. Please note that you can only join one pool at a time so please make sure that you leave Gafi Pool before joining Staking Pool.

Let's join the Basic of Staking Pool, then go deploy the contract again.

3\. Deploy contract after joining Staking Pool

You can see, that now the transaction fee is 7.5 GAKI which is less than 30% compared to the first time not joined the pool.
